### nodemon

`nodemon` is a utility for Node.js applications that helps developers in the development process by automatically restarting the node application when file changes in the directory are detected. This saves developers from having to manually stop and restart their Node.js server every time they make a change to their code.

With nodemon, you can simply start your application using nodemon instead of node, and it will monitor the files in the directory. Whenever a file is modified, added, or deleted, nodemon will automatically restart your Node.js application, making the development workflow smoother and more efficient.

It's commonly used during the development phase to speed up the process of iterating on code changes without the need for manual restarts.

### package.json file

The package.json file is a key component in Node.js projects. It serves as a manifest for the project, containing metadata about the project, its dependencies, and various configuration options. Here are some of the main purposes and components of a package.json file:

1. Project Metadata: Information about the project such as its name, version, description, author, license, and repository.
2. Dependencies: Lists the packages or modules that the project depends on. There are two types of dependencies:

- Dependencies: These are required for the project to function properly in production.
- DevDependencies: These are dependencies that are only required for development or testing purposes, not for production use.

3. Scripts: Defines various scripts that can be executed using npm or yarn. These scripts can include commands for building the project, running tests, starting the application, and more.
4. Configurations: It can include configuration options for various tools or libraries used in the project.
5. Engines: Specifies the versions of Node.js and/or npm required to run the project.

Here's an example of a simple package.json file:

```js
{
  "name": "my-node-app",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "description": "A simple Node.js application",
  "main": "index.js",
  "scripts": {
    "start": "node index.js",
    "test": "echo \"Error: no test specified\" && exit 1"
  },
  "author": "John Doe",
  "license": "MIT",
  "dependencies": {
    "express": "^4.17.1"
  },
  "devDependencies": {
    "nodemon": "^2.0.7"
  }
}
```

In this example, `dependencies` lists the required production dependency (express), while `devDependencies` lists the development dependency (nodemon). The `scripts` section defines two scripts, `start` and `test`, which can be executed using npm run start and npm test respectively.
